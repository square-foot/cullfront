# cullfront
A simple front end generator for SaaS/HTML that can use HTMX and AlpineJS

Take a look at https://cullfront.com 

Currently it is a "Donation Ware" -- but I hope to make it opensource. 
I am hoping to raise $20,000 USD (for various battles I am currently fighting)
at which point in time I would surely make this open-source. 

In the meantime, let us collect the issues for this utility and conduct some useful discussions.

Thanks

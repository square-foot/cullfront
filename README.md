# cullfront
A simple front end generator for SaaS/HTML that can use HTMX and AlpineJS

Currently it is a "Donation Ware" -- but I hope to make it opensource. 
I am hoping to raise $20,000 USD (for various battles I am currently fighting)
at which point in time I would surely make this open-source. 

Download the utility from the main website here: https://cullfront.com 
Docs are here: https://docs.cullfront.com 

In the meantime, let us collect the issues for this utility and conduct some useful discussions.

This README is not modified reguarly. Take a look at main website and documentation
for current version number.

Thanks
Sabu Francis
